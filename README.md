Ã¤hnlich means similar in german. It comprises of multiple tools for usage and development such as:

- [`ahnlich-db`](ahnlich/db): In-memory vector key value store for storing embeddings/vectors with corresponding metadata(key-value maps). It's a powerful system which enables AI/ML engineers to store and search similar vectors using linear (cosine, euclidean) or non-linear similarity (kdtree) algorithms. It also leverages search within metadata values to be able to filter out entries using metadata values. A simple example can look like
```
GET 2 most similar vectors to [0.2, 0.1] using cosine in STORE A where "page" is not "hidden"

// example query
get_sim_n(
    store="A",
    search_input=[0.2, 0.1],
    closest_n=2,
    algorithm=CosineSimilarity,
    condition=Predicate::NotEquals{
      key="page",
      value="hidden",
  },
)
```
- [`ahnlich-ai`](ahnlich/ai/): AI proxy to communicate with `ahnlich-db`, receiving raw input, transforming into embeddings, and storing within the DB. It extends the capabilities by then allowing developers/engineers to issue queries to the same store using raw input such as images/text. It features multiple off-the-shelf models that can be selected for store index and query.
```
CREATE store A with INDEX MODEL all-minilm-l6-v2 and QUERY MODEL all-minilm-l6-v2

// example query
create_store(
    store="A",
    index_model="all-minilm-l6-v2",
    query_model="all-minilm-l6-v2",
)
```
- [`ahnlich-client-rs`](ahnlich/client/): Rust client for `ahnlich-db` and `ahnlich-ai` with support for connection pooling.
- [`ahnlich-client-py`](sdk/ahnlich-client-py/): Python client for `ahnlich-db` and `ahnlich-ai` with support for connection pooling.


## Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](assets/ahnlich.jpg)


## Usage

`ahnlich-db`, `ahnlich-ai` and `ahnlich-cli` are packaged and released as [binaries](https://github.com/deven96/ahnlich/releases) for multiple platforms alongside [docker images](https://github.com/deven96?tab=packages&repo_name=ahnlich)

### Docker Images.

`Note`: 
1. Arguments and commands must be passed in quotes. E.G: `docker run <image_name> "ahnlich-db run --enable-tracing --port 8000"`

2. The CLI comes packaged into the docker images.


### Ahnlich CLI.
Ahnlich ships our CLI that can be used to query either AI or DB binaries.

<p align="left"><img src="assets/cli-clear.gif" alt="ahnlich" height="auto"></p>

To run:
`ahnlich_cli ahnlich --agent .. --host .. --port ...`
where:
  - Agent: Binary to connect to (ai or db)
  - Host: defaults to `127.0.0.1`
  - port: default is infered from the agent selected. (`AI = 1370`, `DB = 1369`) 

#### Example Commands
- **DB**

  - Create Store with dimension 2 and indexes author and country

    `CREATESTORE test_store DIMENSION 2 PREDICATES (author, country)`
  - Set In store
    `SET (([1.0, 2.1], {name: Haks, category: dev}), ([3.1, 4.8], {name: Deven, category: dev})) in test_store`

  
  #### Combining commands
  CLI can process multiple commands at once as long as each command is delimited by `;`
    
    `GETKEY ([1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]) IN test_store;CREATEPREDINDEX (name, category) in test_store`

## Development

### Using Spec documents to interact with Ahnlich DB

To generate the spec documents, run
```bash
cargo run --bin typegen generate
```
It is worth noting that any changes to the types crate, requires you to run the above command. This helps keep our spec document and types crate in sync.

To Convert spec documents to a programming language, run:

```bash
 cargo run --bin typegen create-client <Programming Language>
```
Available languages are:
- python
- golang
- typescript.

In order to communicate effectively with the ahnlich db, you would have to extend the bincode serialization protocol automatically provided by `serde_generate`.
Your message(in bytes) should be serialized and deserialized in the following format => `AHNLICH_HEADERS` + `VERSION` + `QUERY/SERVER_RESPONSE`. Bytes are `Little Endian`.


### How Client Releases Work

The clients follow a similar process when deploying new releases.
[Example with python client](https://github.com/deven96/ahnlich/blob/main/sdk/ahnlich-client-py/README.md#deploy-to-artifactory).
