# Overview

✨ **Ahnlich** is a modern, in-memory **vector database** paired with a smart **AI proxy layer**, designed to simplify the use of semantic embeddings for developers and AI builders with zero external dependencies.

---

## 🧠 What is Ahnlich?

### 🚀 In-Memory Vector Database  
Ahnlich provides an ultra-fast, RAM-resident vector store with:

- **Pure linear similarity search** using **Cosine Similarity**, **Euclidean Distance (L2)**, or **Dot Product** to retrieve semantically similar vectors—ideal for small-to-medium data sets and prototyping.
- **Dynamic update support**—add, update, or delete vectors on-the-fly without full index rebuilds.
- **Metadata support** (tags, categories, timestamps), allowing **hybrid filtering** (e.g. “similarity + metadata condition”) for refined retrieval.
- **Zero external service dependency**—runs as a self-contained binary with no server or cluster required.

*(Support for approximate methods like HNSW or LSH is on the roadmap.)*

### 🤖 AI Proxy Layer  
Built-in intelligent middleware for embedding-based AI workflows:

- Accepts *raw text inputs*, forwards to your preferred embedding provider or LLM, and **caches embeddings locally** to reduce redundant API calls.
- Implements **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** workflows—pull relevant document embeddings, optionally compose prompts, and send to LLMs.
- Tracks **usage metadata** (timestamps, model IDs, query context) for observability and tuning.

Together, these allow building **AI-aware applications** quickly without managing separate services.

## 📚 Vector Databases: Explained

A vector database is purpose-built for **semantic similarity workloads**—it transforms raw content (text/images) into **high-dimensional numeric vectors** alongside their metadata, then stores and retrieves them efficiently for meaning-based search. 

While classic nearest-neighbor search relies on expensive all-pairs or linear scans, modern systems often use **index structures** for approximate methods like HNSW, LSH, or Product Quantization—trading off precision for speed. 

Ahnlich currently supports only **exact, linear similarity search** over updated vectors using these distance metrics:

| Metric           | Description                                      |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Cosine**        | Measures the **angle** between vectors (direction) |
| **Euclidean (L2)**| Computes the straight-line **distance** in vector space |
| **Dot Product**   | Combines **magnitude + alignment**, fast when pre-normalized |

*(Note: Euclidean/L2, cosine, and dot-product are closely related at constant scale.)*

## 🌟 Product Pillars

- **Lightning-fast embedding store** in pure memory, optimized for low-latency lookups.  
- **Hybrid similarity filtering**, combining semantic distance with metadata constraints.  
- **AI-aware proxy engine**, serving as a bridge between your app, embeddings, and LLMs.  
- **Lightweight, deployment-free integration**—no server, cluster, or managed runtime needed.  
- **Developer-first experience**, focusing on speed and simplicity without sacrificing flexibility.

## 🛠️ Use Cases & Applications

- **Document Search & FAQ Retrieval** – Store docs, Markdown content, or product specs as embeddings. Ahnlich retrieves them semantically using cosine/L2, refined by filters like categories or tags.
- **RAG Chat Memory** – Maintain conversational context via embeddings. On each turn, fetch the most relevant past chunks to enrich LLM prompts.
- **Semantic Retrieval of Logs & Snippets** – Developer tooling to find code or log entries that are meaningfully similar—not just keyword matches.
- **Recommendation & Similarity Engines** – Turn items (users, documents, products) into vectors; run coherent similarity + metadata filters (e.g. user locale, rating).
- **Edge & Prototype AI Apps** – No cloud dependency, minimal footprint—ideal for prototyping, embedded deployments, or local development.

## 👥 Who Is It For?

- **Developers and AI/Python engineers** building embedding-based logic or semantic apps.  
- **Startups & MVP coders** needing fast local experimentation without infrastructure overhead.  
- **Data scientists / Machine learning practitioners** benchmarking embedding behavior or clustering.  
- **Educators & technical writers** wanting clear vector-search based examples or teaching tools.
