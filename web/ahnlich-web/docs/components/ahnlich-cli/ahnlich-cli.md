# Ahnlich CLI

The **Ahnlich Command-Line Interface (CLI)** is a lightweight tool that allows developers, researchers, and operators to interact directly with the **Ahnlich AI** and **Ahnlich DB** servers.
It provides a simple way to issue commands using a custom **Domain-Specific Language (DSL)** without writing any code.

Think of the CLI as your **playground** for exploring Ahnlich:

- **Test queries quickly** without setting up an SDK project

- **Experiment with similarity search** and vector operations interactively

- **Prototype pipelines** for embedding, storage, and retrieval

- **Debug servers locally** before moving to production


Although the CLI is a powerful tool for testing, it is not intended as the main integration method. For production applications, the **Ahnlich SDKs (Rust, Go, Python)** should be used, as they provide richer APIs, better error handling, and integration capabilities.
