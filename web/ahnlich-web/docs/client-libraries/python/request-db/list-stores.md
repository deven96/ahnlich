# List Stores

The **List Stores** request retrieves the set of Stores currently registered on the DB server. Each Store corresponds to a logical container of vectors. This operation is commonly used for **introspection**, **administrative tooling**, and **debugging**.

## Behavior
* The client sends a ListStores request.
* The server responds with a collection of registered Stores.
* An empty list means no Stores have been created yet.
