title: Delete Predicate

# Delete Predicate

This request removes all entries in a store that match a specified predicate condition.

* **Input:**

  * `store`: the name of the store.

  * `condition`: a logical predicate that filters which entries should be deleted.

* **Behavior:** Instead of deleting by a specific key, the server scans the store and deletes all entries that satisfy the predicate condition. In this example, it deletes all entries where the metadata field "`job`" equals "`sorcerer`".

* **Response:**
  * `deleted_count` â†’ the number of items successfully deleted.
