# Delete Key

This request removes one or more **keys** (and their associated values) from a store.

* **Input:**

  * `store`: the name of the store.

  * `keys`: a list of vectors (wrapped in StoreKey) that identify the entries to be deleted.

* **Behavior:** The server looks up the given keys in the store. If found, the entries are removed. If a key does not exist, it is ignored.

* **Response:**

  * `deleted_count` â†’ the number of keys successfully deleted.
