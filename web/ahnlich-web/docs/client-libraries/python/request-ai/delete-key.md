# Delete Key

How to delete a key and its associated value from a store using the Ahnlich AI Client.

The `Delete Key` operation removes a single entry from a store. A key uniquely identifies a vector-value pair in the store, and deleting it permanently removes both the key and the stored value.

This operation is useful when:

* You want to remove outdated or irrelevant data.

* You need to clean up test data.

* You want to maintain store integrity by pruning unused keys.

If the specified key does not exist, the behavior depends on the server configuration. In general, no changes are made, and the request safely returns without errors.

  ```py
  import asyncio
  from grpclib.client import Channel
  from ahnlich_client_py.grpc.services.ai_service import AiServiceStub
  from ahnlich_client_py.grpc.ai import query as ai_query
  from ahnlich_client_py.grpc import keyval


  async def drop_key():
    async with Channel(host="127.0.0.1", port=1370) as channel:
        client = AiServiceStub(channel)
        response = await client.del_key(
            ai_query.DelKey(
                store="test store 1",
                keys=keyval.StoreInput(raw_string="Custom Made Jordan 4")
            )
        )
        print(response) # Del()


  if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(drop_key())
  ```
</details>

## Behavior

* **Key match found** → The key and its associated value are permanently removed.

* **Key not found** → No action is performed; the request completes without altering the store.
