# Testing
The crate includes example tests in the repository that demonstrate practical usage of both the DB and AI clients. These tests provide guidance on real-world scenarios and validate expected behavior.

## Key Test Scenarios
* Creating and managing stores.

* Setting and retrieving embeddings and metadata.

* Listing connected clients and available stores.

* Predicate-based queries for filtered retrieval.

* Testing pipelines with multiple requests executed sequentially.

* Validating behavior with image embeddings and structured metadata.

## Purpose
These tests ensure reliability and consistency for operations in both DB and AI pipelines and serve as reference implementations for developers integrating the Ahnlich clients into their workflows.
