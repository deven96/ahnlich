# Type & Utilities

The crate re-exports commonly used parameter and result types through the `prelude` module, simplifying imports across your Rust project. This allows you to access frequently used structures, enums, and request builders without importing them individually from multiple modules.

## Details
* All core types for AI and DB operations are accessible via the prelude.

* For complete type definitions, including structs, enums, and request builders, refer to the **`ahnlich_types` crate**.

* This abstraction improves readability and reduces boilerplate in your Rust code when working with Ahnlich clients.
